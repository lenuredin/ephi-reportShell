Report. Validate. Protect.
> To ensure rapid detection of public health threats, a robust early warning, preparedness and recovery system is required. To achieve this mission, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI) established a fully integrated, adaptable, all-hazards approach called the Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) system, adopting International Health Regulations (2005). Emergency preparedness, early detection, response and recovery from public health emergencies can minimize economic and environmental impacts. Real-time data is the key to this success.
